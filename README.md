# 2nd Project - "Analyzing Retail Sales Data to Enhance Coffee Shop Performance".
Here I go with my second one in a row.

"Analyzing Retail Sales Data to Enhance Coffee Shop Performance". â˜•ðŸ’°

The main objective of this project is to thoroughly analyze retail sales data specific to a coffee shop. By closely examining various aspects such as customer purchasing behaviors, peak sales times, product popularity, and seasonal trends, the project aims to uncover actionable insights that can enhance business operations.

Utilizing advanced data analytics techniques, the project will pinpoint key performance indicators that impact revenue growth and customer satisfaction. The insights gained from this analysis will guide strategic decisions, helping the coffee shop optimize its menu, improve marketing efforts, and streamline service delivery.

This data-driven approach aims to improve the overall performance of the coffee shop, ensuring it not only meets but exceeds market expectations. This will help build a loyal customer base and increase profitability.

Analysis:
- How do sales fluctuate based on the day of the week and the time of day?
- Are there specific peak times for sales activity?
- What is the total sales revenue for each month?
- How do sales differ across various store locations?
- What is the average order value per customer?
- Which products are the top sellers in terms of quantity and revenue?
- How do sales differ by product category and type?
