# 1st Project - Sales Analysis Dashboard
I'm thrilled to present my first ever project, a thorough sales dashboard for a business that offers three different product lines. 

1. Sales by Category: A sales funnel with the most popular subcategories displayed. 

2. Yearly Profit: A line graph that shows the annual profits for every category from 2014 to 2017. 

3. Sales by State: This map illustrates how sales are distributed among the states. 

4. Consumer Count by Year: This bar graph, which peaked in 2017, illustrates annual consumer patterns. 

5. Top 5 Clients: A pie chart displaying the top five clients, with the highest at $5,918.59. 

6. Monthly Sales: The performance of monthly sales is shown in an area chart. Clear insights into sales patterns, top-performing products, and business prospects are offered by this dashboard.
